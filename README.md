About Me
--------

Hello everyone, my name is @Seb-Paoli
I'm a software engineer that enjoy learning new tools and concepts.

Github projects
---------------

You'll find here some of my personnal projects. I'm mainly coding applications
for my own usage but if you find some interests in them, feel free to try them!

If you encounter issues with any of my apps, do not hesitate to open an issue.
As they are my hobby projects, I'll try to address them when I have time to do
so.
